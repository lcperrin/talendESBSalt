# talendESBSalt

The Talend ESB does not have installation instructions for ephemeral servers.  Their instructions are image based, so I thought I would publish the salt-state I've created to install Talend ESB on an Amazon Linux AMI.

This salt will allow for Auto Scaling.  I will comment the limitations I'm aware of in this salt-state.
