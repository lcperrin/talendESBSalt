# talendESBSalt

The Talend ESB does not have installation instructions for ephemeral servers.  Their instructions are image based, so I thought I would publish the salt-state I've created to install Talend ESB on an Amazon Linux AMI.

The external files referenced are either in this repo, or available from Talend.

This salt will allow for Auto Scaling.  I will comment the limitations I'm aware of in this salt-state.
